Stuff yet TODO (in no particular order):

* implement command line flags so we can pass in options.
* support for config file to put options like document root, listen address/port, log leve & destination
* reuse threads for new requests. perhaps spawn set number of worker threads and pass off connections so we're not wasting time setting up
* support connection: keep-alive. right now connections close when response has finished sending
* support MIME types. right now when we service a request we just respond 200 and then the content, no other preamble. browsers are okay with this normally, but we want to be good citizens anyway.
* look into using libdispatch instead of threads to pass connections off to. libdispatch queues are much more lightweight than threads, however this would limit portability. idea: detect platform and use appropriate solution. or maybe we don't care since we're only running this on a Mac anyway :)
