Project October

A (very) simple threaded HTTP daemon mainly for self-educational purposes.

Only supports GET requests. A request is serviced FIFO by a newly-spawned thread which then exits on completion.

See TODO file for a list of planned modifications.

Build:

$ cc -o october october.c
$ sudo ./october

(yeah, I know that means it runs as root, but that's the only way to bind an unprivileged program to a port <1024 in OS X)
